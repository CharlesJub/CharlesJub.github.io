# About Me

Analytics graduate student at the [Institute for Advanced Analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu) with a BS in Computer Science and hands-on experience from collegiate sports analytics. Mostly working in Python, R, and SQL, I combine technical expertise with practical applications in data science. I'm passionate about creative problem-solving, particularly in feature engineering where discovering new perspectives in data can dramatically improve model performance. In my free time by watching hockey games, hiking trails, and reading (typically fantasy) books[1].

# My Projects

## HockeySavant

[Github](https://github.com/CharlesJub/HockeySavant) [Website](http://www.hockeysavant.com/)

A hockey statistics website based on baseball's Baseball Savant that extracts data from the NHL APIs and transforms it into interactive analytics. Built an expected goals model using XGBoost to predict scoring probability, leveraging shot location and game situation data. Developed interactive visualizations to analyze player performance metrics and trends. The architecture includes automated data extraction from NHL APIs, storage in a SQL database, and a Flask-powered web interface for seamless user interaction with the analytics platform.

## House Pricing by Tour Script

[Github](https://github.com/CharlesJub/House-Tour-Pricing)

A data science project analyzing luxury real estate content from YouTube to explore relationships between video content and property prices. Used Python to extract video data through YouTube's API, focusing on content from real estate creator Enes Yilmazer. The project involved cleaning text data from video titles, descriptions, and transcripts to extract home values and relevant features. Applied clustering to separate traditional homes from specialty assets (jets, yachts, RVs). Built an ensemble model using TF-IDF vectorization combined with features like word count, location mentions, and sentiment analysis to predict house prices, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 3.5%.

## CapFriendly Post Analysis

[Github](https://github.com/CharlesJub/CapFriendlyPost/tree/main)

A data analysis project exploring fan-proposed NHL trades from CapFriendly's community forum during the 2023 offseason. Built web scraping tools to collect trade proposals, focusing on which players fans most frequently suggested in trades for each team. Created visualizations to identify patterns in fan trade proposals, highlighting the most commonly suggested trade targets and assets for NHL teams.

## Hurricanes Business Practicum

A collaborative business analytics project with the Carolina Hurricanes NHL organization to optimize season ticket pricing strategies. Working with a team, developed a linear programming model to maximize revenue while adhering to sponsor-specified constraints. The project delivered data-driven pricing recommendations to enhance the organization's ticketing structure.
