    <!-- About Section -->
    <h2>About Me</h2>     
    <p>Analytics graduate student at the <a href="https://analytics.ncsu.edu/">Institue for Advanced Analytics</a> 
        with a BS in Computer Science and hands-on experience from collegiate sports analytics. Mostly working in Python, R, and SQL, 
        I combine technical expertise with practical applications in data science. I'm passionate about creative problem-solving,
        particularly in feature engineering where discovering new perspectives in data can dramatically improve model performance.
        In my free time by watching hockey games, hiking trails, 
        and reading (typically fantasy) books.</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <h3>HockeySavant</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/CharlesJub/HockeySavant">Github</a> 
    <a href="http://www.hockeysavant.com/">Website</a>
    <p>A hockey statistics website based on baseball's Baseball Savant that extracts data from the NHL APIs and transforms 
        it into interactive analytics. Built an expected goals model using XGBoost to predict scoring probability, leveraging 
        shot location and game situation data. Developed interactive visualizations to analyze player performance metrics and trends. 
        The architecture includes automated data extraction from NHL APIs, storage in a SQL database, and a Flask-powered web interface 
        for seamless user interaction with the analytics platform.</p>

    <h3>House Pricing by Tour Script</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/CharlesJub/House-Tour-Pricing">Github</a> 
    <!-- <a href="">Blog</a> -->
    <p>A data science project analyzing luxury real estate content from YouTube to explore relationships between video content 
        and property prices. Used Python to extract video data through YouTube's API, focusing on content from real estate creator 
        Enes Yilmazer. The project involved cleaning text data from video titles, descriptions, and transcripts to extract home values 
        and relevant features. Applied clustering to separate traditional homes from specialty assets (jets, yachts, RVs). Built an ensemble 
        model using TF-IDF vectorization combined with features like word count, location mentions, and sentiment analysis to predict house prices, 
        achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 3.5%. </p>
    <p>Soon: <br>
        - Dashboard <br>
        - Blog post detailing process
    </p>

    <h3>CapFriendly Post Analysis</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/CharlesJub/CapFriendlyPost/tree/main">Github</a> 
    <p> A data analysis project exploring fan-proposed NHL trades from CapFriendly's community 
        forum during the 2023 offseason. Built web scraping tools to collect trade proposals,
         focusing on which players fans most frequently suggested in trades for each team. Created 
         visualizations to identify patterns in fan trade proposals, highlighting the most commonly 
         suggested trade targets and assets for NHL teams. </p>

    <h3>Hurricanes Bussiness Practicum</h3>

    <p> A collaborative business analytics project with the Carolina Hurricanes NHL organization to 
        optimize season ticket pricing strategies. Working with a team, developed a linear programming 
        model to maximize revenue while adhering to sponsor-specified constraints. The project delivered 
        data-driven pricing recommendations to enhance the organization's ticketing structure. </p>
